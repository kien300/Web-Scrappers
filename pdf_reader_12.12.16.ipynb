Descriptions of components should include (as applicable) specifications of the nominalcapacities for mechanical output, electrical output, or steam generation of the identified equipment. For each pieceof equipment identified, clearly indicate how many pieces of that type of equipment are included in the plant, andwhich components are normally operating or normally in standby mode. Provide a description of how thecomponents operate as a system. Applicants for cogeneration facilities do not need to describe operations ofsystems that are clearly depicted on and easily understandable from a cogeneration facility's attached mass andheat balance diagram; however, such applicants should provide any necessary description needed to understandthe sequential operation of the facility depicted in their mass and heat balance diagram. If additional space isneeded, continue in the Miscellaneous section starting on page 19.The photovoltaic solar electric generating system will have a nameplate rating of5.0 MW AC with a maximum net power production capacity of 4.85 MW AC. The Systemwill consist of approximately 21,000 PV modules attached to fixed tilt ground-mount racks. Each module will have a nominal power capacity of 300 watts DC. TheSystem will have a nominal power capacity of 6.31 MW DC with a DC/AC ratio of1.262. The System will utilize 10 pad mounted inverters, each with a nameplatepower capacity of 500 kW AC. The System will be interconnected to the electricaldistribution network operated by Duke Energy Progress. Once the system has beencommissioned, it will remain functioning under normal conditions unless shut downfor maintenance purposes. The facility will be enclosed by a security fence.FERC Form 556Page 10 - Small Power ProductionInformation Required for Small Power Production FacilityIf you indicated in line 1 k that you are seeking qualifying small power production facility status for your facility, then youmust respond to the items on this page.
